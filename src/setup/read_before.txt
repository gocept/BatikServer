You are about to install BatikServer.

BatikServer is an ImageConversionServer. It can convert SVG-Images
into pixel image formats (like PNG or JPEG).  

BatikServer runs Apache's Batik as a server process. So the whole
Java-VM is only loaded once and not again for each conversion request.

Note:
  This product includes software developed by the Apache Software
  Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).
